# Third-Party Service Dependencies

This document outlines the external services that our application depends on, their purpose, and strategies for handling failures or unavailability.

## Core Services

### PostgreSQL Database

**Purpose:** Primary data storage for all application data.

**Configuration:**

- Connection details are configured in `src/utils/dataSource.ts`
- Environment variables control connection parameters

**Fallback Strategies:**

1. **Connection Pooling:** The application uses TypeORM's connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
2. **Retry Logic:** Database operations include retry logic for transient failures.
3. **Circuit Breaker:** For persistent database failures, a circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures.
4. **Read-Only Mode:** If write operations fail, the application can switch to read-only mode for critical functions.

**Monitoring:**

- Database health is checked via the `/api/health` endpoint
- Connection errors are logged with high priority

### Redis Cache

**Purpose:** Caching, rate limiting, session storage, and feature flag configuration.

**Configuration:**

- Connection details are in `src/utils/connectRedis.ts`
- Environment variables control connection parameters

**Fallback Strategies:**

1. **Local Memory Cache:** For short-term caching, the application falls back to an in-memory cache.
2. **Graceful Degradation:** Non-critical features that depend on Redis (like rate limiting) degrade gracefully.
3. **Session Fallback:** For authentication, the application can fall back to JWT-only authentication without session validation.

**Monitoring:**

- Redis health is checked via the `/api/health` endpoint
- Connection errors are logged with high priority

### gRPC Translation Service

**Purpose:** Provides translation services for multilingual content.

**Configuration:**

- Connection details are in `src/utils/translationClient.ts`
- Service discovery is managed through configuration

**Fallback Strategies:**

1. **Return Original Content:** If translation fails, return the original untranslated content with a warning.
2. **Caching:** Successful translations are cached to reduce dependency on the service.
3. **Batch Processing:** Non-critical translations can be queued for batch processing when the service is available.

**Monitoring:**

- Service errors are logged and tracked
- Circuit breaker prevents overwhelming the service during outages

## Email Services

### SMTP Email Service (via Nodemailer)

**Purpose:** Sending transactional emails like password resets and notifications.

**Configuration:**

- SMTP settings are configured in `src/utils/email.ts`
- Environment variables control connection parameters

**Fallback Strategies:**

1. **Retry Queue:** Failed emails are placed in a retry queue with exponential backoff.
2. **Alternative Providers:** The application can switch between multiple email providers.
3. **In-App Notifications:** Critical notifications can be displayed in-app when email delivery fails.
4. **Logging:** All email attempts are logged for manual intervention if needed.

**Monitoring:**

- Email delivery success/failure is logged
- Alerts are triggered for persistent email failures

## File Storage

### Local File System

**Purpose:** Storage for uploaded files and generated content.

**Configuration:**

- Storage paths are configured in application settings
- Permissions are managed by the operating system

**Fallback Strategies:**

1. **Temporary Storage:** If the primary storage location is unavailable, files can be stored in a temporary location.
2. **Error Reporting:** Storage errors are reported to administrators.
3. **Cleanup Procedures:** Regular maintenance tasks clean up orphaned files.

**Monitoring:**

- Disk space and permissions are monitored
- File operation errors are logged

## Dependency Management

To visualize all dependencies, run:

```bash
node scripts/generate-dependency-graph.js
```

This will create a visual dependency graph and a detailed report of all npm dependencies.

## Failure Response Guidelines

When a third-party service fails, follow these general guidelines:

1. **Log the failure** with appropriate context and severity
2. **Implement the fallback strategy** specific to the service
3. **Notify users** if the failure affects their experience
4. **Alert operations team** for persistent or critical failures
5. **Degrade gracefully** rather than showing error pages when possible
6. **Provide clear error messages** that help users understand the issue without exposing sensitive details
